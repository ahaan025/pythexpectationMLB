The Pythagorean expectation, an idea developed by renowned baseball analyst Bill James, can be applied to various sports. In any sports league, teams achieve victories by outscoring their opponents. The relevant scores differ by sport: runs in baseball and cricket, points in basketball, and goals in soccer and hockey (referring to ice hockey as it is known globally, though the concept also applies to field hockey).

The Pythagorean expectation states that a team's winning percentage in a season is proportional to the square of the total runs/points/goals they score divided by the sum of the squares of the total runs/points/goals they score and the total runs/points/goals they allow.

In formulaic terms, this can be expressed as:

\[ \text{wpc} = \frac{T_F^2}{T_F^2 + T_A^2} \]

where \( T_F \) represents the runs/points/goals scored, and \( T_A \) represents the runs/points/goals conceded.

This concept not only explains team success but also serves as a predictive tool for future results.
